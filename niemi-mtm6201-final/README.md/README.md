Throughout this assignment I found out that bootstrap really makes building a website a lot easier. 

I did find some issues with the responsive images so I'd set the max-width to 400 or 600x because I found that once I get to desktop view the images take up most of the screen. 

In the home page I had to add the same text in two different divs to try and get the result that I was lookimg for.
